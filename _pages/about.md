I am a graduate of Covenant University, Nigeria

Passonate about research and mathematics

Coming from a backgrond in material science, I have a strong background in mathematics and anylitical skills

My Research interest lies in Deep Learning and its multidicsciplinary applications.

I am passionate about making machine learning and its many benefits accessible to all.


# Selected Experiences

### Deep Learning for Multiclass Traffic Sign Recognition using the German Traffic Sign

[View Project](/files/project2.html)

-	Implemented a multiclassifier model using deep learning techniques to classify diverse traffic signs with an accuracy of over 83%.

-	Developed and fine-tuned a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the LeNet architecture, incorporating convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers for robust feature extraction and classification.

-	Utilized TensorFlow and Amazon SageMaker for model training and deployment, ensuring scalability and performance.

-	Demonstrated the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios, showcasing the potential for deep learning in enhancing road safety and autonomous driving.


### Predicting Retail Store Sales with XGBoost
[View Project](/files/project1.html)

- As part of my study and passion for applying machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios, I undertook a significant project focused on "Predicting Retail Store Sales with XGBoost.

- Conducted extensive data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and regression analysis, to identify key drivers and relationships affecting retail sales.

-	Achieved model precision with low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), highlighting the effectiveness of XGBoost in enhancing retail operations and decision-making.


## Technical Team Lead

-	Founded and led Tektransform, an innovative organization, driving the creation of an edtech product, Sceem-ai â€“ an AI-powered learning platform designed to teach digital skills adaptive content delivery and a personalized learning approach.

- Led a multidisciplinary team of Designers and Data Analysts, orchestrating the development of 
Sceem-ai from concept to realization, enhancing user engagement and skill acquisition.

- Distinguished among the top 15 globally in the Global Changemaker Program, outshining over 570 
applicants from 87 countries.
