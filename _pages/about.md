I am a graduate of Covenant University, Nigeria

Coming from a backgrond in material science, I have a strong background in mathematics and anylitical skills

My Research interest lies in Deep Learning and its multidicsciplinary applications.

I am passionate about making machine learning and its many benefits accessible to all.


Selected Experiences
======

## Deep Learning for Multiclass Traffic Sign Recognition using the German Traffic Sign

- I have experience developing a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using TensorFlow for the classification of various traffic signs.

- Utilized the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset, which consists of 43 classes of traffic signs.

- Implemented the LeNet CNN architecture for image classification, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

- Trained the CNN model on the dataset using Amazon SageMaker, optimizing hyperparameters and achieving high accuracy.

- Deployed the trained model for making real-time predictions.
