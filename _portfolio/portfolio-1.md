In this Project, I embarked on a deep learning journey to tackle multiclass traffic sign recognition. Leveraging the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset, I employed the LeNet model to create a robust classifier. Through extensive training and validation, the model achieved an impressive 83% accuracy. This project demonstrates the viability of deep learning in real-world applications, particularly in autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems, where precise recognition of traffic signs is crucial for safety and efficiency.
