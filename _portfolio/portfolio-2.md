This project is centered on forecasting weekly sales for a diverse array of retail stores using the powerful XGBoost algorithm. In addition to model development, I conducted thorough data analysis, including exploratory data analysis and regression analysis. These insights guided strategic decision-making within the retail domain. My role extended beyond modeling to encompass data visualization, ensuring that findings were effectively communicated to stakeholders. The resulting model exhibited impressive precision with minimal error metrics, emphasizing its potential to drive substantial improvements in retail operations and decision-making processes.
